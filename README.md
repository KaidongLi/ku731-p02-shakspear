This project focuses on using line information to predict who's the player.

## Original thoughts

Besides the info already in the dataset, I take the number of words in each line and the average number of letters in each word. I was trying to establish the speaking habits of each player. This is based on the idea that each person would have their own preferred vocabulary. Then after visualization, I discovered most of English words or sentences falls into intervals of certain length. There're differences, but with hundreds of players involved, they are difficult to distinguish.

## Improvement

I added information about lines happenning before and after each line
